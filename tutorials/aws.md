# Abstract
This guide is designed to help a completely novice developer set up Amazon Web Services to host their site.

# Before you get Started
There are a few steps that obviously need to be done that I'm not going to get into for brevity's sake but should be very simple to figure out:

* Purchase a domain. Where you decide to purchase it from is purely up to you and honestly doesn't matter since you will be using Amazons Route 53 for DNS management.
* Sign up for Amazon Web Services. You can use an existing amazon account if you like

### Launch Server
First, let's fire up an EC2 instance. Amazon makes this very simple to do and while very serious projects will require some advanced configuration, a simple set up is all we need for our purposes.

* From the AWS Console select EC2
* Select "Launch Instance"
* Select "Quick Launch Wizard"


The quick launch screen is fairly simple and asks you to name your instance and create a key pair. You will use this key to SSH to your server securely with root access without the use of a password (you don't want to use a password for many reasons that I won't get into). Give this new key pair a name and and select download. this will save your key (key_pair.pem) wherever you choose on your machine, but I recommend you move this key pair to a safe place on your machine like ~/.ssh. 

### Configure Ports
Great, now you have an instance up and running but that alone isn't really good for anything. In order for it to actually serve HTTP you need to open up the appropriate ports. The first step is to set up a security group. A security group acts like a configuration file for a firewall. It lets you set which ports are open to the world and which are closed.Click on the Security Groups tab. If you used the quick launch wizard AWS should have created a group for you titled something like "quicklaunch-1". You can use this or create your own security group. 

* Select the desired security group
* At the bottom of the screen, select the "Inbound" tab.
* Select SSH from the "create new rule" drop down and click "Add Rule". This will open up port 22, necessary if you want to have SSH access to your instances.
*  Repeat the process for port 80 (HTTP) and, if desired, port 443 (HTTPS).

### Connect to Server
Now, if you want to SSH to your instance all you have to type is:

```sh
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_key_pair.pem ec2-user@ec2-00-000-000-00.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```
##### Warning, if using Ubuntu or another image the user could be root or ubuntu instead of ec2-user 

Using the Public DNS that you find in your EC2 properties panel for that last part.  If you are unfamiliar with ssh  please jump to [SSH](ssh.md). 

### Elastic/Dynamic IP
Now you have successfully configured your instance you need to be able to point your domain towards the server that you created. For convenience sake you will want to use what Amazon calls Elastic IP. This allows you to assign a unique IP address to your instance which makes managing DNS records easier. You can also easily switch which instance your Elastic IP is associated with, which can be helpful if you have several servers for development and may need to switch which server your domain points to. Adding an Elastic IP is simple:

* From the EC2 console select Elastic IPs
* Select Allocate New Address
* Choose Associate Address and then choose the instance you just created.

### Creating DNS Records
Finally in order for your www.domain.com to point to the server that you just started you need to update the DNS records for the domain. I would recommend using Amazon's Route 53 simply because it consolidates the services that you have to use to make changes. You'll first want to go to the Route 53 page and create a new Hosted Zone. Next, add all of the record sets that you may need (MX, CNAME, A, www, etc.). Finally return to your domain provider and change the name servers to those listed on your zone file at AWS.

# Build your Environment
So you're connected to your EC2 instance… What now? In the past the next steps were pretty straightforward and hardly disputable: Install and configure the typical LAMP stack technologies: PHP, MySQL and Apache. Most often, if you are a front-end developer you may not be very comfortable with learning a server side language like php or python. If this is the case you should be very excited about a new technology called Node.js If you have no idea what Node is, it is essentially Javascript for the server side. Your eyes probably light up at the idea alone, since JS has certainly become the default scripting language of the web. Most importantly, many beginners have experience with javascript, giving them the opportunity to expand their development to the server side.

There are many advantages to Node.js, but when choosing to build a site using it one has to keep in mind that it is not a very mature technology. The young, ever-changing nature of Node.js can present a challenge for developers. Regardless, Node is a reliable enough technology that is used by companies of the likes of Yahoo, Linkedin and many more. I have hopped on the bandwagon and recommend Node for it's simplicity above all.

If you are using Ubuntu or other Linux distributions you will likely be using apt-get or yum to do your install. Once you have your package manager of choice in place your installation process can take seconds.

The first thing that you will probably be prompted to do when you ssh to your instance is to update. Obviously updating is always a good idea, so before you do anything else you should be sure to "sudo yum update".

### Install Nginx
Apache is by a long shot the most popular web server in existence (It is the A in LAMP after all) but many people are starting to realize the benefits of dumping Apache for Nginx because it is lighter and faster at serving static files. Using Nginx rather than Node's HTTP server does not only provide advantages in speed, but also allows you to run multiple node processes at once and proxy them all through nginx. Installing Nginx is a breeze and its' configuration is simple:
```sh
sudo apt-get install nginx
emacs /etc/nginx/nginx.conf // update config with information like root location, domain name etc.
sudo service start nginx
```
Socket.io requires installing a version of nginx past 1.3, apt-get only has 1.19 so you should install from source
```sh
wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.4.3.tar.gz

tar xvzf (.tgz or tar.gz)
tar xvjf (.tbz or .tar.bz2)
tar xvf (.tar)

./configure
make
sudo make install
ln -s /sbin/nginx /usr/sbin
# update your configuration files to your liking
sudo service nginx start
```
And really that's it. Nginx has great documentation for their servers and I would suggest spending some time reading as much as necessary, being sure to use [best practices](http://wiki.nginx.org/Pitfalls). You'll also notice that an nginx.conf file is included in the boilerplate (config/nginx.conf). This is a configuration file that I would suggest using as it proxies node through nginx and uses nginx to serve static files rather than express (along with many other improvements to the default file taken from [this article](http://blog.argteam.com/coding/hardening-node-js-for-production-part-2-using-nginx-to-avoid-node-js-load/)). I like to symlink this file to /etc/nginx so that you can keep your config files under version control as well. For production, you will need to make sure that Nginx is running and that you have symlinked the public directory to the correct place for nginx.


### Install Ruby
Another piece of software that will be required is Ruby. While it comes preinstalled on Mac, you will need to install it on your Ubuntu server. This can be done easily using the Ruby version manager [RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install)
```
\curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
```
Afterwards you can install the gems that you will need:
```sh
gem install sass compass
```

### Install Node
Installing and running node is a fairly straightforward process. Depending on what you're building you may require a specific version of Node.js, but this tutorial assumes you're fine with using the latest version.

Using Ubuntu makes this much easier. For detailed guides to using package managers to install node please [visit here](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager).
```sh
sudo apt-get install node		#installs an old standard version
# to install the latest stable release
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python-software-properties python g++ make
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:chris-lea/node.js
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```
The detailed long form version (Amazon Linux)
```sh
sudo yum install gcc-c++ make
sudo yum install openssl-devel
sudo yum install git
git clone git://github.com/joyent/node.git
cd node
./configure
make (will take 30+ mins)
sudo make install
```
Add to sudo's path:
```sh
sudo su
vi /etc/sudoers
```
Use the down keyboard arrow to find this line: "Defaults    secure_path = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin"
add ":/usr/local/bin" to the end of the line
### Install npm
A great feature of Node is that it comes with a simple package manager that can allow you to extend node and download modules.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/isaacs/npm.git
cd npm
sudo make install
```
### Install Ghost
Ghost is a cool blogging platform built in node.js that I think could be the future Wordpress. It is really easy to install:
```sh
curl -L https://ghost.org/zip/ghost-latest.zip -o ghost.zip

unzip -uo ghost.zip -d ghost
cd /path/to/ghost
npm install —production
npm start

# or to start with forever
NODE_ENV=production forever start index.js
```

From here you have Ghost Running, the next step is to configure Ghost to work on your deployment solution. Detailed guides are [available here](http://docs.ghost.org/installation/deploy/).
### Install PHP
For some people node.js just isn't enough and they need to use Wordpress, often out of legacy. For these people I have some sympathy, and you could modify this stack to use PHP easily, guide coming soon
### Install Varnish
Varnish is a HTTP cache/accelerator, Combining Nginx super fast static file processing and Node's fast IO with Varnish's enhanced caching is a great recipe for speed. First install Varnish:
```sh
# via https://www.varnish-cache.org/installation/ubuntu
curl http://repo.varnish-cache.org/debian/GPG-key.txt | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb http://repo.varnish-cache.org/ubuntu/ precise varnish-3.0" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install varnish
```


### Build Your Node.js App
Now that you have node installed I would suggest using a node.js boilerplate to get your app up and running. I have provided a boilerplate that you can use to get started. Simply:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/cdrake757/nodejs-boilerplate
```
If you want to add a private repo to your server, you have a few options. The simple solution is to clone the repo to a local machine and then scp the files to the server, but this can be very clunky. I would suggest using github deply keys which gives you single repo access, but this method is not devoid of disadvantages. <insert a link on deploy keys> This should be more than enough for you to get started with your own site. The provided boilerplate uses Express, Jade and Stylus. The important files to consider are:
* public/stylesheets/style.style.styl > Your core stylus document that should be included on each page. Personally, I prefer to keep all of my styles in one place with the exception of a few CSS libraries that you should import (animate.css, normalize.css etc.)
* routes/site.js > a simple router for rendering your templates
* config/config.js > a file for separating configurations, like port and host.
* server.coffee > You main app configuration file. You can run the app simply with
* coffee server.js // note that if you use forever you will have to compile coffee script to js

# Storage & Backup
One of the best features of Amazon AWS is that it has several storage solutions of varying levels of price, avaialability and durability. The correct usage of Amazon Web Services will probably use all three of the major storage solutions:
* Elastic Block Storage: A large-capacity persistent disk to attach to your server
* Simple Storage Service: For storing large quantities of file with very high availability and durability.
* Glacier: Very low cost, low availability storage for archives

### EBS
Attaching EBS to a server is very simple and is done in the AWS EC2 console. Once you select a disk of an appropriate size and attach it, you will still have to mount this disk on the server:
TODO: ATTACH INSTRUCTIONS

### S3
A great primary solution for cloud storage and backup is Amazon s3. It is very affordably priced for most user's needs and can give you maximum durability and availability. I have found that s3fs, an s3 FUSE based file system is a great way to 
mount a bucket on my server and even local machine for transferring large amounts of files to s3.

```sh
brew install s3fs

# or for linux 
wget http://s3fs.googlecode.com/files/s3fs-1.74.tar.gz
tar xvzf s3fs-1.74.tar.gz
cd s3fs-1.74/
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install

# now you need to add your AWS security keys to the server's home dir
emacs .passwd-s3fs
# paste in AWSSECRET:AWSSECRETKEY

chmod 600 ~/.passwd-s3fs

# finally mount an s3 bucket on the server
/usr/local/bin/s3fs mybucket /mnt
```
