# Dotfiles for Shell Domination
I learned how to use the command line a few years ago and I use it exclsuively today, so I am always looking for ways to increase my productivity. One thing that that I found very early on is that if you maintain a library of configuration files (dotfiles, as they're known) your life programming on the command line becomes significantly easier.
I am a designer, and I use many GUI apps (Photoshop, Lightroom, Textmate, ect.), but in the shell is where I amcan accomplish the most.
In order to install these files in the home directory you need only run:
```sh
./boostrap.sh
```
and the files will be synced and sourced to the directory.
